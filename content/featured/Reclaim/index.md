A Combat Rhythm game made for ECS 189L, a Gameplay Programming course. This was developed in C# on Unity.

My role in this project entailed setting up the Input Systems and finding and implementing music. Utilizing C#, I was able to implement the various inputs needed to navigate dialogue, UI, and gameplay, as well as implementing a Sound Manager to easily play sound effects and music within the game.
