This is a side project where I implemented a DNS client and server from scratch using Python's Socket API.

The Python program implements DNS protocol specifications, including DNS queries and responses, and enables effective communication with DNS servers. I explored how DNS queries are built and sent, and how to parse the data received back from the DNS server. Additionally, I emulated a DNS server that iteratively resolves input DNS queries by consulting the root name server, the TLD name server, and finally the authoritative DNS server to resolve the IP Address of the requested hostname.
