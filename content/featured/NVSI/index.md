This is a website that was built for the New Viet Nam Studies Initiative.

For this project, I worked as a backend developer with 3 other backend developers and 10 frontend developers at an organization called #Include. My role as a backend developer included implementing the Strapi Content Management system,along with hosting the CMS on Heroku, and managing media uploads to Cloudinary. I also helped to write the REST API calls to link the frontend to the CMS.
